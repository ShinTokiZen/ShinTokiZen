<h2> World Peace</h2> </center>
<p> A statement we all have heard before but rarely have seen. 
  Of course, everywhere we go, we always see someone shouting at each other even before leaving your Home.
   So is World peace a fallacy? is world peace, just an imagination by people who are tired of wars,
  destruction, corruption and even perjury? Most people will say yes, for it's merely a dream and because of
  us greedy Humans that it will stay as a dream. But, as I said, Only Most people will say yes, there are also a number
  of us who longed for peace, as we humans spent 90% of our time in earth in wars in a span of Thousands of years.
