<h1>Welcome to "a test of patience"</h1>
<h2>this site may not be much but I am sure proud of it.
 (read this if you have a long time for yourself)
  lets just think of it as a test of patience. 
How long do you think you can last reading a 
  14 year old's scribble talking about nonsense in a website
made by yours truly or trully well I dont know. 
  But hey dont think too negatively ang just live your life.
and hey there mr. Teacher trying to grade my work or should I just say sir Oloya. 
  well either way dont expect 
too much for this is merely a test of patience. 
  I dont know how to do or add voices in these things and I cant 
come to lessons because I got extremely sick. 
  I guess life is just that hard you know. Either your on the top
nor bottom. Even though this is extremely not 
  necessary, I did enjoy it this time because one of my dreams 
is becoming a game developer if my psychology 
  degree didnt show up. Speeking of Psychology, Well if one of 
you are one of those depressed little {redacted}
  oops, language. depressed little, ... umm kids? well
anyway if you are depressed, just so you know you'renot alone. 
  I've been there too and I will admit that I was
not planned AKA a mistake, My family did love me, 
  and boy did they love punching on me. well not literall punch
but you know, urghh what do you call those again? 
  uuurghhh anyway not literally. And I became the punching bag 
of the household. Ok I gotta admit that Back then
  I was a little brat, But even now they still blame me
for everything. Not only that during the pandemic I was 
  strucked with a F**king skin disease, That'll work right?
And it dries and make your skin so itchy allday everyday.
  I was also having social problems with my lack 
of  confidence in my new self aka dried like a fish in the sun
  look. Having a severe skin disease, a pandemic 
and being a punching bag. surely it wont get any worse right?
  WRONG, Large Boils appeared in my skin so big 
you can compare it to one of those pinballs.
  My skin dried up to the point where I can
  peel of my skin and it will 
show you the flesh part while being screamed at everyday(Not Childabuse).
  Ok im sorry at this point your probably 
Thinking "oh shut up you cant get sympathy for me".
  Suck it up. My website My rules. So any ways 
I Tried doing it. I tried to kick the bucket multiple times yet I failed.
  I wont dwelve into the details
Because Its borderline NSFW but If you're having a tough time, Dont do it, 
  instead, accept it. I accepted
the fact that Im Depressed, and instead of doing yourself, 
  I made an imaginary friend whom became my psychologist.
I learned a few tricks of, How to not care or how to tune people out. 
  Because I know that without me, my
Parents will think "Crap I wasted money on that kid" haha jk.
  They will ofcourse be disheartened now I'll
be back to drink cold water first. Alr Im back, now where was I,
  Oh yeah im just writing anything that came to my
Mind. Oh right, anyway dont do it, your life is worth way more than what you think,
  There are people 
Who love you. If you're an Orphan well, I guess Your Foster Parents love you..???
  If not then maybe God does.
If you're an athiest then your bed loves you, If your Homeless
  and you dont have anything else. Then learn to
love your self. Anyways That's why I wanted to speciallize in Psychology.
  Wow Gotta admit If you're still
  here then give yourself a pat on the back read more to grab your
   prize. Wooow I just looked at the website itself to see how
  ugly it turns out but hoo boy is it super ugly
Now let's have a sun talk about my most favorite parable. The Prodigal Son. 
Sure it's pretty sweet, Son spends money on a Ancient strip club, buys a Ferrari horse
had a lot of fun, while the other brother, worked his ass off and did not
get a single penny. It's a good Story. BUT not the most Realistic of 
them all. First if I am the prodigal son, I would rather die 
of heatstoke than go back to the family in shame. Second if I am the father
I will behead him. 3rd, If I am the Brother, I will break
every bone in his body. Sadly I am not them and I dont
know humility nor forgiveness. what the hell, I mean sure, the bible
is a fun story made by cristians to promote beeing Good. and
To be honest, I am a bit skeptical about this God buisness. 
I'm half sure that Jesus just went around telling people 
to be nice then he got killed because he kept telling people to be nice
Now you might be wandering. "But Shin Oh noo He did some miracles
right?" well sweetie it's been 2000 years. We dont even know what
happened at the 1000s, plus the church back then are the devils.
back to the parable, F000 the father, he shouldve went straight 
for the head. Fu** Forgiveness. My parents still brings
up the Times where I did something wrong even tho its been years
and they still use it as a leverage. what the hell men. 
also F**k the son for accepting the party. You shouldve just
went straight to work. Plus you should not have wasted money
in the first place geez u need to learn to invest to some stonks
Plus he spent it all on a strip club and gambling which is the worst way.
people should stop trying to find the easy way and just use the money for
practical purposes. Very annoying. still, I really like how cliche the
story was so that's the rant about The prodigal son.
Alr Finally, our last ted talk.

Existential Crisis. So how real are we? Are we 
living phsycally or this is just you know, Fake.
I recently watched an episode of rick and morty 
which talks about how anything we sense is all fake 
there are other beings, humans or not tweaking 
our brain, Or we're just in a jar because it certainly
is possible. To be honest I kinda dont care. I've already]
talked about how depressed I am and I just dont really value my
life that much, In the end, I know that everything is just useless
But It's not to the point where I would end it myself. 
Its just that if it ends, then so be it. but that may not be the 
case for some people. plus Existential crisis comes in many forms 
like are we alone in this univers? Boom aliens.
I do believe that aliens exist or existed but no to the point 
where it visit us. The universe is so large that our feeble minds
cant comprehend half of it. Questions like How is everything created
or is everything real is pretty normal considering the world is
full of mysteries. Not only that, there is also the multiverse
theory, where there are infinte universes with infinite possibilities
outside our own universe. There is probably a Universe Where I am 
bruce lee or stephen hawking but can walk. There is a 
universe where I'm an alien lifeform. heck It's also
possible for me to become a chair in some universes.
Thinking about it, I am pretty jealous about my other self 
who is a billionare living in a private island with lots of hot babes,
cars, swords, planes, boats, and a spaceship at my backyard.
Which makes you think again, Do you matter. Yes, Yes you do.
Because exactly you are here at the moment. there are people who depends
on you, There are people who care, you dont need to worry about 
the multiverse, the universe, or even if you are fake.
Focus on what you have right now. 
Just like master oogway's quote 
"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift."
...
