<h2> World Peace</h2> </center>
<p> A statement we all have heard before but rarely have seen. 
  Of course, everywhere we go, we always see someone shouting at each other even before leaving your Home.
   So is World peace a fallacy? is world peace, just an imagination by people who are tired of wars,
  destruction, corruption and even perjury? Most people will say yes, for it's merely a dream and because of
  us greedy Humans that it will stay as a dream. But, as I said, Only Most people will say yes, there are also a number
  of us who longed for peace, as we humans spent 90% of our time in earth in wars in a span of Thousands of years.
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut3WhMeEPt8">World Peace Is Not a Myth.</a> It is merely a wall for
  us Humans to overcome, and we have shown that it is very possible during the 2020-2022 pandemic. We all extended
  hands on people in need, as well as helping the environment ourselves. For example, the community pantry we 
  Filipinos have implemented, It showed how generous humans can be even at the times where products are limited.
  Famous artists, entertainers, youtubers and many more deciding to help <a href="https://teamseas.org/">Reduce waste 
  in the ocean.</a> </p> <p>

So, We're not that far off from both world peace and totally annihilating ourselves from the face of the world.
and so
