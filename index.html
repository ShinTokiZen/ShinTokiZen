<h1>Welcome to my very first Site made in less than 10 minutes</h1>
<h2>this site may not be much but I am sure proud of it. lets just think of it as a test of patience. 
How long do you think you can last reading a 14 year old's scribble talking about nonsense in a website
made by yours truly or trully well I dont know. But hey dont think too negatively ang just live your life.
and hey there mr. Teacher trying to grade my work or should I just say sir Oloya. well either way dont expect 
too much for this is merely a test of patience. I dont know how to do or add voices in these things and I cant 
come to lessons because I got extremely sick. I guess life is just that hard you know. Either your on the top
nor bottom. Even though this is extremely not necessary, I did enjoy it this time because one of my dreams 
is becoming a game developer if my psychology degree didnt show up. Speeking of Psychology, Well if one of 
you are one of those depressed little {redacted} oops, language. depressed little, ... umm kids? well
anyway if you are depressed, just so you know you're not alone. I've been there too and I will admit that I was
not planned AKA a mistake, My family did love me, and boy did they love punching on me. well not literall punch
but you know, urghh what do you call those again? uuurghhh anyway not literally. And I became the punching bag 
of the household. Ok I gotta admit that Back then I was a little brat, But even now they still blame me
for everything. Not only that during the pandemic I was strucked with a F**king skin disease, That'll work right?
And it dries and make your skin so itchy allday everyday. I was also having social problems with my lack 
of  confidence in my new self aka dried like a fish in the sun look. Having a severe skin disease, a pandemic 
and being a punching bag. surely it wont get any worse right? WRONG, Large Boils appeared in my skin so big 
you can compare it to one of those pinballs. My skin dried up to the point where I can peel of my skin and it will 
show you the flesh part while being screamed at everyday(Not Childabuse). Ok im sorry at this point your probably 
Thinking "oh shut up you cant get sympathy for me". Suck it up. My website My rules. So any ways 
I Tried doing it. I tried to kick the bucket multiple times yet I failed. I wont dwelve into the details
Because Its borderline NSFW but If you're having a tough time, Dont do it, instead, accept it. I accepted
the fact that Im Depressed, and instead of doing yourself, I made an imaginary friend whom became my psychologist.
I learned a few tricks of, How to not care or how to tune people out. Because I know that without me, my
Parents will think "Crap I wasted money on that kid" haha jk. They will ofcourse be disheartened now I'll
be back to drink cold water first. Alr Im back, now where was I, Oh yeah im just writing anything that came to my
Mind. Oh right, anyway dont do it, your life is worth way more than what you think, There are people 
Who love you. If you're an Orphan well, I guess Your Foster Parents love you..??? If not then maybe God does.
If you're an athiest then your bed loves you, If your Homeless and you dont have anything else. Then learn to
love your self. Anyways That's why I wanted to speciallize in Psychology. Wow Gotta admit If you're still
  here then give yourself a pat on the back and email me at shintokizeno@gmail.com For a prize.</h2>
