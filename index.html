<h2> World Peace</h2> </center>
<p> A state we all long to achieve before but barely ever felt. 
  Of course, everywhere we go, we always see someone shouting at each other even before leaving your Home.
  So is World peace a fallacy? Is world peace just an imagination by people who are tired of wars,
  destruction, corruption and even perjury? Most people will say yes, for it's merely a dream. And because of
  us greedy Humans, will it stay as a dream?</p>
<p>As mentioned, MOST will say yes, but there are also a number of who have been praying for peace. 
  We humans spent 90% of our time in earth in wars in a span of Thousands of years. But,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut3WhMeEPt8">World Peace Is Not a Myth.</a> It is merely a wall for
  us Humans to overcome, and we have shown that it is very possible during the 2020-2022 pandemic. We all extended
  hands to help people in need as well as helping the environment to heal. For example, the community pantry we 
  Filipinos have implemented, it showed how generous humans can be even at the times where supplies are limited.
  Famous artists, entertainers, youtubers and many more deciding to help restore the beauty of the environment <a href="https://teamseas.org/">Reduce waste

 <p>So, We're not that far off from both world peace and totally annihilating ourselves from the face of the world.
And so, what are we waiting for? Are we just gonna stand here and watch the whole world burn and make the lives 
of the incoming generations more miserable, instead of just putting our greed aside and try to help each other,
and maybe, just maybe, fix everything wrong in this Godforsaken World. So, please, Let's just put aside our hunger for oil
land and other materialistic desires, and try to look deeper and fix on what is truly wrong in this world.</p>
